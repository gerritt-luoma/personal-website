# Personal Website
## Overview
This repository contains my personal website project.  I am using this project as a way to familiarize myself with fullstack development.  I am creating this website with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.  The site will initially contain only a static homepage with a basic overview of the site and future plans but will evolve over time to contain pages for my resume, analytics and descriptions for future projects, and a development blog.

## Goals
1. Gain experience with and a better understanding of fullstack development
2. Develop skills with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, and NoSQL
3. Create a responsive website that can be properly viewed on any website
4. Gain an understanding of how to write automated tests with Jest, React testing library, and Cypress
5. Gain an understanding of how to setup CI/CD pipelines with Github actions
